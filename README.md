# BertelsmannChallengeCloudTraining
Training repository for Bertelsmann Challenge Cloud

Welcome to my repository that will help us train our GIT skills!
Let's start!


1. Let's see how many of us is there
a) fork the repository
b) go to your GitHub profile
c) clone the repository to your local drive
d) go to folder called "logo" (maybe using terminal?)
e) copy there your own logo (funny picture, gif, whatever you want!) - please, for identification reasons, name it NAME_OF_YOUR_GITHUB_ACCOUNT-YOUR_NAME_ON_SLACK
f) create commit, telling what you did and push the changes to repository
!g) go back to main (this) repository on authors account and create pull request (probably that won't work automatically, then just let me know to add you as a contributor - my log√≠n on Slack is @Ola)

START!
